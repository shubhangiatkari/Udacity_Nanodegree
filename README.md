# Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Project Motivation
I was interested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to answer the following questions:

1. Which counties embrace work from home most?
2. Does Work From Home impact job satisfication?
3. How to find a work from home developer job?
# File Descriptions
There is one iPython notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The Data folder contains the survey data used by this analysis.

# Results
1. The top five countries with the highest proportion of work from home developers are Iran, Pakistan, Czech Republic, Ukraine, and Russian Federation.
2. We are more than 99.9% sure that the work from home developers have better job satisfaction ratings than the ones who commute.
3. These factors tend to lead to a work from home job:
- Jobs in Iran, Pakistan, Ukraine, etc.
- Part-time developers
- Pre-series A startup companies
- Developers who are more serious about work
The main findings of the code can also be found at the post available here.
